# ReelPy

**ReelPy** is a modern Python library designed to simplify video editing by combining the power of FFmpeg with an easy-to-use, Pythonic API. Whether you’re editing small clips or working on complex video projects, ReelPy provides a high-performance, flexible solution for Python developers.

## Features
- **High Performance**: Built on FFmpeg, ReelPy ensures fast video processing with minimal re-encoding.
- **Pythonic API**: Intuitive and easy-to-use, allowing you to handle video processing with minimal code.
- **Seamless Migration from MoviePy**: Designed to maintain feature parity with MoviePy, making it easy for existing users to switch.
- **Parallel Processing**: Leverage parallelism to speed up rendering and encoding tasks.
- **Extensibility**: Supports advanced use cases such as automated video pipelines and AI-driven video manipulation.

## Installation

You can install **ReelPy** via pip:

```bash
pip install reelpy
```

## Quickstart

Here’s a simple example of how to use **ReelPy** to load a video, trim it, and save the output:

```python
from reelpy import VideoFileClip

# Load a video file
clip = VideoFileClip("my_video.mp4")

# Trim the video (first 10 seconds)
trimmed_clip = clip.subclip(0, 10)

# Save the output
trimmed_clip.write_videofile("output.mp4")
```

## Key Concepts

- **VideoFileClip**: The main class for loading video files and performing operations like trimming, concatenating, and adding effects.
- **FFmpeg Integration**: All heavy processing tasks are handed off to FFmpeg to ensure optimal performance.
- **Pythonic API**: With simple, readable syntax, you can easily perform complex video manipulations.

## Migration from MoviePy

If you are familiar with MoviePy, transitioning to ReelPy will be easy. The API is designed to be compatible with MoviePy, with additional enhancements for performance and usability. Check out the Migration Guide (Coming Soon) for a detailed comparison.
